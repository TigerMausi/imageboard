# Imageboard Project

A fancy imageboard for collecting all your travelling photos.

This project was made in 5 days during the 12 weeks intensive coding bootcamp at SPICED Academy.

## Overview

An Instagram-style, single-page application website, where anybody can upload an image of their choosing, add a title along with a textual description of that image and where other user users could view that image and add some comments to it.

## Techstack

**JavaScript | Handlebars | Vue.js | AWS S3 | Node.js | Express.js | PostgreSQL**

## Features

On the main page there will be a screen with the most recent uploaded images arranged responsively.

<!--If the image upload is successful, the server should respond with a payload containing the url of the image. When the client receives this response, it should update the list of images it already has to include the image that was just uploaded. This should cause automatic re-rendering of the list of images with the newest image now appearing.-->
